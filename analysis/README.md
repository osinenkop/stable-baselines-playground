## Contributing Guidelines

### Analyzing Results

For experiment analysis:
1. Create a new subdirectory in [`analysis/`](./) that matches your experiment's name in [`../run/`](../run)
2. Use Jupyter notebooks or other analysis tools to document your findings
3. Include clear documentation of analysis methods and results

For cross-experiment analysis:
1. Create a new subdirectory in [`analysis/`](./) with a descriptive name
2. Document the relationships between experiments being analyzed
3. Maintain clear references to the original experiment data
